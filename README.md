# Manga Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a web-based manga recommendation system. It allows users to receive manga recommendations based on their viewing history and emotional preferences. The application is designed to provide a personalized and engaging experience for manga enthusiasts.

## Features

- **User Viewing History-Based Recommendations:**
  - Suggests manga titles based on a user's past viewing habits.
- **Emotion-Based Recommendations:**
  - Provides manga recommendations tailored to one of five emotions: `Happy`, `Sad`, `Angry`, `Surprised`, and `Funny`.
- **Interactive and User-Friendly Web Interface:**
  - Built with Vite and Node.js for a fast and seamless frontend experience.
- **Efficient API Backend:**
  - Developed with Flask to handle recommendations and data efficiently.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- **Vite:** Build tool for fast and optimized development.
- **Node.js:** For managing dependencies and frontend logic.

### Backend

- **Flask:** Lightweight Python web framework to create APIs.
- **Recommendation Algorithm:** Custom logic based on user history and emotions.
